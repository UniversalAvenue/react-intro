## What's this?
A small starting point for experimenting with react.
Uses [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.htm) and [babel](https://babeljs.io/)

## Setting up
Simply clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/UniversalAvenue/react-intro.git` make sure you have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/) and run npm install

Also make sure you run `npm run watch` to make sure you have the javascript bundle ready for use.

## Working with the example
Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Making changes
After having made changes make sure you re-build the bundle with `npm run watch`

## Going further
Some ideas to add to this to make it more interesting
1. Add ability to add custom list item text
2. Experiment with a flux implementation to handle actions / have a centralized state
3. Add ability to remove a list item
